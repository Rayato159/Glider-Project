This report is a part of the 537314 Flight Mechanics. The purpose of this report is to explain whole about of glider which we design whether why we need design like this.  
It’s just not only about to glider design but include manufacture, flight testing, inspection after flight testing and financial report.  
We describe step by step for who want to learn how to produce some small glider by our concept.  
This project is full of obstacles, because we just study the mechanics of flight and don’t know as much about aircraft design. Therefore, we used all the knowledge from aerodynamics and this subject by the full of power for produce the best glider as we can.  
Finally, If you read to this. We hope you to get the highest of knowledge by our report.  

**Define Objective**
 1.	Wingspan 1 m
 2.	Reynold number <= 400000 (Incompressible Flow)
 3.	Initial attitude 2 m
 4.	Longest range gliding
 5.	Low weight
 6.	High Cl/Cd and AR
 7.	High stiffness

**Conceptual Design**  
	The most important of glider is about to design for low weight, high Cl/Cd and AR, but in this project. We must design for high stiffness for structural test in another project.
	First step. We need to define wing shape. From objective we need high Cl/Cd and AR then we define chord about 100 mm and we are all know as the best wing shape is elliptic wing (For lift produce on wing. Because elliptic wing has Oswald efficiency number = 1) But elliptic wing is hard to manufacture. Then taper wing is better to manufacture. Taper wing give speed more than rectangular wing for long range gliding. The good taper ratio are about 0.3 to 0.4. We choose taper ratio 0.4 and sweep angle 0 degree because is easy for manufacture. Then choose T tail for stable.
	Next step. We used the RC plane calculator website to define all dimension and improve some dimension for suitability to structure.
	Finally. We used Solidworks CAD software to design this glider, find center of gravity and calculate empty weight. Assume material to balsa wood.
