This report is a part of the 537314 Flight Mechanics. The purpose of this report is to explain whole about of glider which we design whether why we need design like this.  
It’s just not only about to glider design but include manufacture, flight testing, inspection after flight testing and financial report.  
We describe step by step for who want to learn how to produce some small glider by our concept.  
This project is full of obstacles, because we just study the mechanics of flight and don’t know as much about aircraft design. Therefore, we used all the knowledge from aerodynamics and this subject by the full of power for produce the best glider as we can.  
Finally, If you read to this. We hope you to get the highest of knowledge by our report.
